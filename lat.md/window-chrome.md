# Window title bar and conversation tabs

The top strip of the main window is a browser-style title bar: it is the window's drag region, and the open-conversation tabs live *on* it rather than in a separate bar below, so no vertical space is spent on a dedicated, always-empty drag strip.

On macOS the window is frameless (`titleBarStyle: "hiddenInset"`, traffic lights inset at x/y 16 — see [[src/main/index.ts]]), and [[src/renderer/src/App.tsx]] renders a fixed full-width `.drag-region` (`-webkit-app-region: drag`, z-index 1000) so the whole top band — including over the sidebar/traffic-light area — drags the window. This strip is mac-only; other platforms keep the OS title bar.

`.app` fills the window (`height: 100vh`) so the chrome reaches every edge. The sidebar is a flush full-height panel: it only rounds its left corners (`border-radius: 16px 0 0 16px`) to follow the window's rounded corners, while its right edge is square against the content column.

## Tabs layered above the drag region

[[src/renderer/src/screens/Layout/ActiveSessionsBar.tsx#ActiveSessionsBar]] is the content column's title bar. It owns the top band browser-style: empty space drags, the chips stay clickable.

- The bar itself is `-webkit-app-region: drag` with `position: relative; z-index: 1001`, so it stacks above the global `.drag-region` (z 1000) and is the drag handle for the content column.
- Each `.active-session-chip` opts back out with `-webkit-app-region: no-drag`, keeping select/close clickable above the drag layer — the same priority model browsers use for tabs over a draggable tab strip.
- `min-height: 34px` (≥ the 28px global drag strip) means content rendered after the bar clears the fixed drag layer, so the old `.is-mac .content { padding-top: 28px }` offset is no longer needed.

Visually the strip is a Safari-style tab bar: the strip uses the darker `--bg-secondary` toolbar shade; tabs are flat (no border/fill) and separated by thin vertical dividers drawn with an `::before` on each non-first chip. The active tab fills with `--bg-primary` — the same colour as the transparent content area below it — and rounds its top corners, so it docks into the page; the dividers flanking the active tab are hidden for a seamless join.

## Always present, even with one conversation

The bar always renders so it is always a drag area, but chips appear only when there is something to switch between. With a single idle conversation the strip is an empty toolbar band, costing no extra bar height.

Chips show when more than one run is open, or any run is loading (`showChips` in [[src/renderer/src/screens/Layout/ActiveSessionsBar.tsx#ActiveSessionsBar]]).

Because the bar doubles as the drag strip, [[src/renderer/src/screens/Layout/Layout.tsx]] renders it as the first child of `.content`; the verify-warning banner (when shown) sits just below it, clear of the drag layer.
