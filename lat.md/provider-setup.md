# Provider setup

The first-run screen where the user picks an AI provider and enters credentials before the app is usable. Rendered by [[src/renderer/src/screens/Setup/Setup.tsx]], it writes the chosen provider/base-URL via `setModelConfig` and any key via `setEnv`.

The provider list is data-driven from `PROVIDERS.setup` in [[src/renderer/src/constants.ts]]. Each entry carries an `envKey`, `configProvider`, `baseUrl`, and `needsKey`; selecting a card drives which form fields show (API key, or the Local server/base-URL flow).

## Top grid mirrors the agent's native providers

The top provider grid shows only providers the upstream agent supports natively; generic OpenAI-compatible endpoints live in the Local presets instead.

The source of truth is `CANONICAL_PROVIDERS` in the bundled agent (`hermes-agent/hermes_cli/models.py`) — the registry of providers with first-class auth/base-URL handling (nous, openrouter, anthropic, openai-codex, openai-api, gemini, xai, xiaomi, ollama-cloud, deepseek, …). A card belongs in the top grid only if it maps to a canonical slug. `aimlapi` was removed from the grid because it has no canonical entry; it remains reachable as a **Local → Remote OpenAI-Compatible APIs** preset.

## OpenAI-compatible endpoints route through Local

Endpoints the agent does not natively support (Groq, DeepSeek, Together, Fireworks, Cerebras, AtlasCloud, Mistral, AIML, …) are offered as `LOCAL_PRESETS` chips under the `local` card, not as top-level cards.

Selecting a preset sets the base URL; the API-key env var is resolved by `resolveCustomEnvKey` — first an exact `LOCAL_PRESETS.envKey` match, then [[src/shared/url-key-map.ts]] by host. So a compatible provider configures correctly without a dedicated card (e.g. `api.aimlapi.com` → `AIMLAPI_API_KEY`).

## Provider icons

Each card's logo is resolved by [[src/renderer/src/components/common/BrandLogo.tsx]] from the provider id, falling back to a generic robot for unknown ids.

`detectBrand` matches the provider/model string to a `BrandKey`, and `matchTheme` flattens every logo to a single white/black tint so colored and `currentColor` SVGs render uniformly in the grid's logo tiles.

The Local/Remote preset chips are also branded: each renders the same `BrandLogo` (by preset id) to the left of its name in a row. `llama.cpp` is mapped off the Meta logo to the generic API mark (the `/llama/` substring would otherwise tag it, and Ollama, as Meta); any preset without a bundled logo falls back to the generic mark.
